title: Joining
---

We're seeking talented post-doctoral researchers and data scientists to join our interdisciplinary research team on an ambitious multi-year mission to develop cutting-edge computational tools for monitoring, diagnosing, and updating ML/AI algorithms. The goal is to ultimately rigorously test and deploy these tools in multiple hospital systems.
If this opportunity excites you, please see below!
The team is led by Drs. Feng and [Suchi Saria](https://suchisaria.jhu.edu/). Other team members include faculty across UCSF, JHU, and Northwell with expertise in ML/AI/statistics and medicine, including [Fan Xia](https://profiles.ucsf.edu/fan.xia), [Julian Hong](https://profiles.ucsf.edu/julian.hong), [Lucas Zier](https://profiles.ucsf.edu/lucas.zier), [Arjun Sondhi](https://asondhi.github.io/), and more!

# Postdoctoral researchers [4 openings]
The position (100% funded) will be for two years, with potential for continuation.
Salary and benefits are competitive.

## Primary responsibilities:
* Develop tools for monitoring, diagnosing, and updating ML/AI systems in real-world clinical settings with rigorous statistical guarantees. See example papers from our group [here](https://ai.nejm.org/stoken/default+domain/WHP5GAV5DNNC8FSNKFSD/full?redirectUri=doi/full/10.1056/AIra2400657), [here](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v236/feng24a.html), [here](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2104626), [here](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v130/subbaswamy21a.html), and [here](https://doi.org/10.1111/biom.13379).
* Design and implement robust, scalable software libraries and data pipelines
* Collaborate with deployment teams to ensure developed tools work well in real-world settings
* Prepare and submit research manuscripts and technical reports

## Qualifications:
The post-doctoral researcher position requires at least a PhD degree in computer science, (bio)statistics, data science, or related fields.
We are looking for someone who:
* has experience in methodological development and can perform independent research, with a strong and relevant publication record
* (preferably) has experience in at least one of these fields: sequential monitoring, multiple hypothesis testing, machine learning, causal inference, post-prediction inference
* is comfortable working with large datasets as well as data from different modalities (tabular, imaging, text)
* is able to work collaboratively with a team

# Data scientist [2 openings]
The position (100% funded) will be for two years, with potential for continuation.
Salary and benefits are competitive.

## Primary responsibilities:
* Architect, implement, and maintain ETL pipelines that extract data from the Electronic Health Record (EHR) system and support monitoring, diagnosing, and updating ML/AI systems in real-world clinical settings
* Design and implement robust, scalable software libraries and data pipelines
* Collaborate with deployment teams to integrate tools into real-world systems

## Qualifications:
The data scientist position requires a BS (preferably MS) in computer science, data science, (bio)statistics, or related areas.
We are looking for someone who:
* has a strong software engineering background
* has experience in building ETL pipelines
* is excited to getting their hands dirty with real-world clinical data
* is able to work collaboratively with a team
