We're looking for a post-doc and data scientist! See a description of the position below.

-------

## The project:
Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and the Division of Cardiology is at the forefront of applying artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) to help improve outcomes in vulnerable and underserved populations.
We are seeking a postdoctoral researcher and data scientist to join our ML predictive analytics team and help create a data warehouse  develop and validate ML algorithms that support clinical decision making and hospital performance improvement efforts, and research projects and papers.

The data scientist position requires a minimum of a Masterâ€™s degree or equivalent level of experience in computer science, (bio)statistics, or another relevant field. A proven track record of productivity within academia or industry in publishing and/or developing and applying new algorithms is necessary for this role.  The candidate should have experience developing in a Linux environment, using git-based workflows, writing in Python/R, using high-performance computing, and working collaboratively with a multidisclinary team. Ideally, the candidate also has experience cleaning and analyzing Electronic Health Record (EHR) data, creating datawarehouses for data analytics, and experience/interest in developing new ML algorithms.

Our ML predictive analytics team is highly collaborative and includes team members with wide-ranging expertise:
* Jean Feng
* [Lucas Zier](https://profiles.ucsf.edu/lucas.zier): a cardiologist at UCSF and ZSFG
* [Jim Marks](https://sfghf.org/team/james-d-marks-md-phd/): an anesthesiologist at UCSF and ZSFG, Chief of the Medical Staff and Chief of Performance Excellence at ZSFG

## The position:
We are looking to hire a postdoctoral researcher and data scientist to join the team.
The position (100% funded) will be for 2-years, with the possibility of extension.
Salary and benefits are competitive.

## Qualifications:
The data scientist position requires a master's degree or equivalent in computer science, data science, (bio)statistics, or another relevant field.
We are looking for someone who:
* has experience with database design and creating ETL pipelines
* has experience training and testing machine learning algorithms

The postdoctoral position requires a PhD degree or equivalent in computer science, data science, (bio)statistics, or another relevant field.
We are looking for someone who:
* has experience developing ML algorithms
* can perform independent research

For both positions, the candidate should:
* be able to work collaboratively with a team
* has experience developing in a Linux environment, using git-based workflows, writing in Python/R, use high-performance computing
* have interest in analyzing Electronic Health Record (EHR) data and unstructured clinical notes! :)
