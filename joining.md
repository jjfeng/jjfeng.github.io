## The project:
Machine learning (ML) algorithms have become important tools for leveraging healthcare data to improve patient outcomes and streamline hospital processes.
Nevertheless, concerns regarding the reliability of these algorithms remain a barrier to their widespread adoption, as these algorithms may perform poorly in certain populations and/or decay in performance over time.
The aim of this project is to develop tools that explain what the main causes for a performance gap.
We'll be drawing on various techniques, including causal inference, semi-parametric inference, and feature attribution methods.
We'll also be integrating these tools with sequential monitoring procedures to develop ML monitoring systems that both detect and explain performance drift over time.
We've planned for a number of exciting real-world case studies that  involve analyzing EHR data from UCSF, ZSFG, and Duke University.
Upon project completion, we will distribute these tools as open-source software packages for use by ML developers as well as hospital IT/data science teams.

This collaborative project includes team members with wide-ranging expertise:
* [Julian Hong](https://honglab.ucsf.edu/), a radiation oncologist who developed the SHIELD-RT algorithm for predicting acute care needs in radiation therapy patients and conducted [one of the first RCTs for ML-guided care](https://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/JCO.20.01688)
* [Romain Pirracchio](https://www.romainpirracchio.org/), an anesthesiologist and biostatistician who has written a textbook on statistical modeling for ICU data
* [Mi-ok Kim](https://profiles.ucsf.edu/mi-ok.kim), a mathematical statistician who develops methods for causal inference, adaptive clinical trials, and longitudinal data
* [Alexej Gossmann](https://www.alexejgossmann.com/), a mathematical statistician at the FDA who, among other things, develops methods for  biomedical imaging data

## Qualifications:
The position requires a PhD degree or equivalent in (bio)statistics, computer science, or another relevant field.
We are looking for someone who:
* has experience doing methods development
* can perform independent research
* can work and collaborate with a team
* has experience developing in a Linux environment, using git-based workflows, and writing in Python/R

## Applying
If you are interested in this position, please submit the following materials:
* A cover letter
