## The project:
Machine learning (ML) algorithms have become important tools for leveraging healthcare data to improve patient outcomes and streamline hospital processes.
Nevertheless, concerns regarding the reliability of these algorithms remain a barrier to their widespread adoption, as these algortihms may perform poorly in certain populations and/or decay in performance over time.
The aim of this project is to develop tools that explain what the main causes for a performance gap.
We'll be drawing on various techniques, including causal inference, semi-parametric inference, and feature attribution methods.
We'll also be integrating these tools with sequential monitoring procedures to develop ML monitoring systems that both detect and explain performance drift over time.
We've planned for a number of exciting real-world case studies that  involve analyzing EHR data from UCSF, ZSFG, and Duke University.
Upon project completion, we will distribute these tools as open-source software packages for use by ML developers as well as hospital IT/data science teams.

This collaborative project includes team members with wide-ranging expertise:
* [Julian Hong](https://honglab.ucsf.edu/), a radiation oncologist who developed the SHIELD-RT algorithm for predicting acute care needs in radiation therapy patients and conducted [one of the first RCTs for ML-guided care](https://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/JCO.20.01688)
* [Romain Pirracchio](https://www.romainpirracchio.org/), an anesthesiologist and biostatistician who has written a textbook on statistical modeling for ICU data
* [Mi-ok Kim](https://profiles.ucsf.edu/mi-ok.kim), a mathematical statistician who has developed new methods for causal inference, adaptive clinical trials, and longitudinal data
* [Alexej Gossmann](https://www.alexejgossmann.com/), a mathematical statistician at the FDA whose developed methods for analyzing biomedical imaging data

## Qualifications:
The position requires a PhD degree or equivalent in statistics, computer science, or another relevant field.

### Essential skills:
We are looking for someone who has:
* experience doing methods development
* clear ability to perform independent research
* the ability to work and collaborate with a team

### Additional helpful skills
Ideally the candidate would have:
* experience with PyTorch or TensorFlow
* experience with a modern git-based workflow
* experience developing in a Linux environment

## Applying
If you are interested in this position, please submit the following materials:
* A cover letter
* A CV summarizing your education and work experience so far.
* The names and email addresses of three references.
* One representative publication.
* A code sample showing work that you are proud of. This has to be nontrivial, but doesn’t have to be long. Ideally it would be publicly accessible, e.g. on GitHub, but if that’s not possible an emailed attachment is fine too.
* Contact information for three references

Please send these materials to [PI's email] if you're interested.

Screening of applicants will begin immediately and will continue as needed throughout the recruitment period. The fellow will start as soon as March 2023.
The position will come with a competitive postdoc-level salary with great benefits for two years, with the ability to extend if things are going well.
