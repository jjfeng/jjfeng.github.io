# Postdoc or AI Engineer for the PROSPECT Team

Our team serves as the data science arm of the [PROSPECT lab](https://zsfg-prospect.github.io/), which is the digital innovation team at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital. The mission of PROSPECT is to improve health outcomes and equity in vulnerable and underserved populations through the application of novel technologies and digital tools. Our team is composed of experts in machine learning, artificial intelligence, data science, informatics, building and analytics within the electronic health record, health equity and social determinants of health. We're looking for a postdoc or AI engineer to join our team, who will help research, architect, implement, and scale AI technologies at the hospital.

## Primary Responsibilities
Responsibilities vary based on a postdoc vs engineering role but generally include:
* Develop and deploy HIPAA compliant AI applications that integrate directly into the EHR system
* Build data pipelines that process high volumes of clinical notes and multi-modal Electronic Health Record (EHR) data
* Create robust infrastructure and tooling to enable and accelerate AI research efforts for the broader team
* Conduct independent research on how to ensure the safety, reliability, and effectiveness of clinical AI tools
* Collaborate closely with clinicians, informaticists, and interdisciplinary team members
* Prepare and submit research manuscripts to ML/AI conferences and/or clinical AI journals
* Design and implement open-source software packages for the research and clinical communities

## Qualifications
The position requires an MS or PhD in computer science, data science, or a related field and/or equivalent working experience. We are looking for someone who:
* Has strong software engineering skills with experience building production systems
* Has experience with cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, or GCP) and containerization (e.g., Docker)
* Is proficient in designing databases, building scalable data pipelines, and processing large-scale datasets
* Can work independently and take ownership of complex technical projects
* Has experience with EHR systems and healthcare data integration (strongly preferred)
* Has experience with natural language processing and processing clinical notes (strongly preferred)
* Has interest in methodological development and independent research (strongly preferred)

<!--# Postdoctoral Fellow in monitoring clinical impact of AI tools

This project aims to develop novel statistical and computational methods for monitoring changes in the *clinical* impact of AI-enabled devices, such as AI scribes and clinical risk prediction models. A critical aspect of this project is to think through how the AI’s impact is mediated through the user of the AI device, and how human+AI interactions affect what we can (or cannot) monitor. This project is co-led by Drs. Jean Feng and [Fan Xia](https://profiles.ucsf.edu/fan.xia) from UCSF as well as the FDA’s CDRH/OSEL/DIDSR team, and will be supported by the UCSF [IMPACC group](https://docit.ucsf.edu/news/first-continuous-ai-monitoring-platform-clinical-care).

## Primary Responsibilities
* Develop tools for monitoring AI-enabled medical devices, with rigorous statistical guarantees
* Extract, process, and analyze multi-modal Electronic Health Record (EHR) data (e.g., clinical notes)
* Design and implement open-source software packages and federated data pipelines
* Collaborate closely with interdisciplinary team
* Prepare and submit research manuscripts to ML/AI conferences, statistics journals, and/or clinical AI journals

## Qualifications
The postdoctoral researcher position requires a PhD in statistics, biostatistics, computer science, data science, or a related field. We are looking for someone who:
* Has strong experience in methodological development and independent research, with a strong publication record
* Has a strong computational background and is comfortable processing large-scale, multi-modal datasets
* (Preferably) Has methodological expertise in one or more of: causal inference, sequential monitoring, changepoint detection, ML/AI, natural language processing, federated learning, longidutinal data analysis

# Postdoctoral Fellow in developing clinical AI monitoring systems
This project aims to develop a suite of statistical and computational methods that hospitals can use to monitor changes in performance of clinical AI algorithms and, subsequently, diagnose the root cause and update the model.
The team is led by Drs. Feng and [Suchi Saria](https://suchisaria.jhu.edu/). Other team members include faculty across UCSF, JHU, and Northwell with expertise in ML/AI/statistics and medicine, including [Fan Xia](https://profiles.ucsf.edu/fan.xia), [Julian Hong](https://profiles.ucsf.edu/julian.hong), [Lucas Zier](https://profiles.ucsf.edu/lucas.zier), [Arjun Sondhi](https://asondhi.github.io/), and more!

## Primary responsibilities:
* Develop tools for monitoring, diagnosing, and updating ML/AI systems in real-world clinical settings with rigorous statistical guarantees. See example papers from our group [here](https://ai.nejm.org/stoken/default+domain/WHP5GAV5DNNC8FSNKFSD/full?redirectUri=doi/full/10.1056/AIra2400657), [here](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v236/feng24a.html), [here](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2104626), [here](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v130/subbaswamy21a.html), and [here](https://doi.org/10.1111/biom.13379).
* Design and implement robust, scalable software libraries and data pipelines
* Collaborate with deployment teams to ensure developed tools work well in real-world settings
* Prepare and submit research manuscripts and technical reports

## Qualifications:
The post-doctoral researcher position requires at least a PhD degree in computer science, (bio)statistics, data science, or related fields.
We are looking for someone who:
* has experience in methodological development and can perform independent research, with a strong and relevant publication record
* (preferably) has experience in at least one of these fields: sequential monitoring, multiple hypothesis testing, machine learning, causal inference, post-prediction inference
* is comfortable working with large datasets as well as data from different modalities (tabular, imaging, text)
* is able to work collaboratively with a team
