# Postdoctoral researchers [4 openings]
The position (100% funded) will be for two years, with potential for continuation.
Salary and benefits are competitive.

## Primary responsibilities:
* Develop tools for monitoring, diagnosing, and updating ML/AI systems in real-world clinical settings with rigorous statistical guarantees.
* Design and implement robust, scalable software libraries and data pipelines
* Collaborate with deployment teams to integrate monitoring tools into real-world systems
* Prepare and submit research manuscripts and technical reports

Our team is highly collaborative and includes members with wide-ranging expertise:
* Jean Feng: PI of the project. Primary advisor of postdoctoral researcher.
* [Suchi Saria](https://suchisaria.jhu.edu/): Co-PI of the project and co-advisor of postdoctoral researcher. 
* And many others, including Fan Xia, Julian Hong, ...

## Qualifications:
The post-doctoral researcher position requires at least a PhD degree in computer science, (bio)statistics, data science, or related fields.
We are looking for someone who:
* has experience in at least one of these fields: sequential monitoring, machine learning, and causal inference
* has experience in methodological development and can perform independent research, with a strong and relevant publication record
* has strong software engineering background
* is able to work collaboratively with a team

# Data scientist

## The project:
After a machine learning (ML)-based system is deployed, monitoring its performance is important to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the algorithm over time. When an ML algorithm interacts with its environment, the algorithm can affect the data-generating mechanism and be a major source of bias when evaluating its standalone performance, an issue known as performativity. Although prior work has shown how to validate models in the presence of performativity using causal inference techniques, there has been little work on how to monitor models in the presence of performativity. The goal of this project is to bring together techniques from causal inference and statistical process control to develop a comprehensive framework for post-market monitoring of ML algorithms. This work builds on a number of our previous works, including [this paper](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v236/feng24a.html) that was published at the Conference of Causal Learning and Reasoning (CLeaR) and was presented at the NeurIPS Regulatable AI workshop.

We are seeking a postdoctoral researcher to join our lab. The primary responsibilities are:
* Develop new statistical methods/frameworks for post-market monitoring of ML algorithms
* Implement a software package that can be readily used by ML developers, health AI deployment teams, and ML auditors/regulators
* Write, edit, and publish research manuscripts in collaboration with the team

Our team is highly collaborative and includes members with wide-ranging expertise:
* Jean Feng: PI of the lab. Primary advisor of postdoctoral researcher.
* [Fan Xia](https://profiles.ucsf.edu/fan.xia): Co-advisor of postdoctoral researcher. Assistant Professor in the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at UCSF. Research interests include causal inference, clinical trial design, and machine learning.
* [Alexej Gossmann](https://www.alexejgossmann.com/): Staff Fellow and mathematical statistician in the Division of Imaging, Diagnostics, and
Software Reliability (CDRH/OSEL/DIDSR) at the FDA. Research interests include performance evaluation of AI/ML-enabled medical devices and software in medicine.
* And many others, including Berkman Sahiner, Gene Pennello, [Adarsh Subbaswamy](https://asubbaswamy.github.io/), Nicholas Petrick, [Romain Pirracchio](https://profiles.ucsf.edu/romain.pirracchio), and Mi-Ok Kim!

## The position:

## Qualifications:
The post-doctoral researcher position requires at least a PhD degree in (bio)statistics, computer science, data science, or another relevant field.

* has experience in at least one of these fields: sequential monitoring, machine learning, and causal inference
* has experience in methodological development and can perform independent research, with a strong and relevant publication record
* has strong software engineering background (e.g. python, git-based workflows, high-performance computing)
* is able to work collaboratively with a team
