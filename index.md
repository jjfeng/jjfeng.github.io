I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the University of California, San Francisco and the UCSF-UC Berkeley Joint Program in Computational Precision Health.
My research interests include the interpretability and reliability of machine learning methods for biomedical applications, particularly those involving black-box models.

I completed my Ph.D. in Biostatistics under [Noah Simon](https://faculty.washington.edu/nrsimon/) and [Erick Matsen](https://matsen.fhcrc.org/) at the University of Washington.
Before that, I studied computer science at Stanford and was a software engineer at [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/).
