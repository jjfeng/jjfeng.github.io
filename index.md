I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the University of California, San Francisco and the UCSF-UC Berkeley Joint Program in Computational Precision Health and a principal investigator at the [UCSF-Stanford Center of Excellence in Regulatory Science and Innovation (CERSI)](https://pharm.ucsf.edu/cersi).
I am also the data science lead on the [PROSPECT team](https://zsfg-prospect.github.io/), the digital innovation taskforce for the Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital.


My research interests span the interpretability, reliability, and regulation of machine learning (ML) algorithms in healthcare.
Recent projects include fairness auditing, performance monitoring, and safe updating of ML algorithms.
My wide-ranging methodological interests include high-dimensional statistics, multiple hypothesis testing, causal inference, semiparametric theory, deep learning, and generative AI.

I completed my Ph.D. in Biostatistics under [Noah Simon](https://faculty.washington.edu/nrsimon/) and [Erick Matsen](https://matsen.fhcrc.org/) at the University of Washington.
Before that, I studied computer science at Stanford and was a software engineer at [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/).

It was an honor to share our work with regulators and industry members, and energizing to see academia, regulators, and industry all come together to shape regulatory policies for AI in healthcare.
- **Jan 2024**: What a month! Our lab has one paper accepted at the Conference on Causal Learning and Reasoning (CLeaR): ["Monitoring the performance of machine learning algorithms that induce feedback loops: what is the causal estimand"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11463). We also have two papers accepted at AISTAT: [Is this model reliable for everyone? Testing for strong calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15247) (**oral!**) and [Monitoring machine learning-based risk prediction algorithms in the presence of performativity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09781).
- **Nov 2023**: Our lab has two papers accepted at the [Regulatable AI Workshop at NeurIPS](https://regulatableml.github.io/)! One on a [causal monitoring framework for ML-based medical devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11463) (selected for oral) and one on sample size calculations for model fairness audits.
