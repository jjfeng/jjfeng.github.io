I am an Assistant Professor In-Residence in the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the University of California, San Francisco.
My research interests include the interpretability and reliability of machine learning methods for biomedical applications, particularly those involving black-box models.

I completed my Ph.D. in Biostatistics under [Noah Simon](https://faculty.washington.edu/nrsimon/) and [Erick Matsen](https://matsen.fhcrc.org/) at the University of Washington.
Before that, I studied computer science at Stanford and was a software engineer at [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/).

## Tutorials and Short Courses

- Nov 2020: I taught a [short course](https://www.biostat.washington.edu/news/calendar/symposium) on supervised statistical learning with [Ali Shojaie](http://faculty.washington.edu/ashojaie/) on November 15th at the 6th Seattle Symposium in Biostatistics. ([Slides](teaching/Seattle_Symposium_ShortCourse2020_ML.pdf))
- August 2020: I taught a [short course](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/research/precision-prevention/machine-learning-boot-camp-analyzing-biomedical-and-health-data) on machine learning for biomedical and health data with [Noah Simon](https://faculty.washington.edu/nrsimon/) and [Cody Chiuzan](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/people/our-faculty/cc3780).
